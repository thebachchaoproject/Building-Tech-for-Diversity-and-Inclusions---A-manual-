For software -- in this case a web or mobile platform -- to be inclusive and user-friendly, it is necessary that the six steps incorporate certain practices. We have compiled some of those practices with examples, so that a technical team may follow them easily.

*What should the reader expect to find in this manual?*

A set of guidelines for designing and improving technological platforms (web and mobile) in ways that make them utilitarian and friendly to a diverse group of users. This manual may be used by those who have no experience or formal training in the context of diversity and inclusion issues. It contains a set of individual and collective lessons from various practitioners around the world.

*What will the reader be able to do after perusing this manual?*

*Create a web or mobile platform that is inclusive.

*Grant-makers and funders trying to evaluate a technical project as a potential grantee could use the manual as a ready reckoner to determine if the proposed project fits the necessary criteria for inclusivity. Grantors of a technology-based project in a development or civil rights organisation could use it to decide what it takes to promote technology use in their granteeâ€™s works.

*For an organisation that is planning a technology-based project, the manual provides some curated knowledge to use as a starting point.
